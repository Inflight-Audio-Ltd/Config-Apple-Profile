# Most array functionality is tested as part of the tests that are done on the
# basic data types.  However, there are some array-specific tests that are
# here.

# TODO: Test STORESIZE, CLEAR, and SPLICE

# We will be testing the following
#  * Storing into an array should fail
#  * Deleting from an array should fail
#  * Exporting as a plist should work
#  * Clearing an array shoud work
#  * Putting items into a cleared array should work
#  * All forms of splicing should work:
#    * Splicing to clear an array
#    *

# Clear the array, and make sure it's now empty

# Add 5 items to the array

# Splice 5 items onto the beginning

# Splice 3 items onto the end

# Splice 7 items in near the middle

# Remove 3 items from near the middle

# Remove 5 items off the end

# Check that the array has 12 items, in expected order

# Splice the array into emptiness

# Check that the array is empty

# Done!
