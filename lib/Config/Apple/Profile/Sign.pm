Config::Apple::Profile::Sign - Digitally sign configuration profiles


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Config::Apple::Profile;
    use Config::Apple::Profile::Payload::...;
    use Config::Apple::Profile::Sign;
    
    my $profile = new Config::Apple::Profile;
    
    # ... create your payloads and add to $profile ...
    
    my $signer = new Config::Apple::Profile::Sign;
    
    $signer->set_signer($signing_cert, $signing_key, $password);
    # Or $signer->set_signer_path($cert_path, $key_path, $password)
    
    my $signed_profile = $signer->sign($profile);

    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used to digitally-sign configuration profiles.  This is the last
step in the profile-creation process.  A signed configuration profile is binary
data that may not be modified.  The binary data is a DER-encoded PKCS#7 data
structure, containing the configuration profile, the signature, and the
certificate associated with the private key used to make the signature.

The signed configuration profile should be given the extension C<.mobileconfig>,
the same extension for unsigned configuration profiles.  The MIME type is
C<application/x-apple-aspen-config> (again, this is the same MIME type for
unsigned configuration profiles).  The configuration profile I<must not be
modified or further encoded>.  For example, do not Base64-encode the profile.

The build script must have detected a usable version of OpenSSL (version 0.9.8
or later) in order for this module to be usable.  To confirm that OpenSSL is
available, check the variable
C<$Config::Apple::Profile::Config::ACP_OPENSSL_PATH>.  If it is defined, it
will contain the path to a usable C<openssl> binary.

To sign a configuration profile manually using OpenSSL, you must first
create the .mobileconfig file, which can then be signed using the following
command:

    openssl smime -sign -in your.mobileconfig -out your_signed.mobileconfig
    -outform der -signer your_signing_cert.pem -inkey your_signing_key.key
    -nodetach

All of the parameters above are required.  If your signing key is encrypted,
you will be prompted for the passphrase to decrypt the key.


=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 new()

Returns a new object.  If C<$Config::Apple::Profile::Config::ACP_OPENSSL_PATH>
is not defined, this dies immediately.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS


=head2 set_signer($signing_cert, $signing_key, $password)

Set the private key and certificate to be used for signing.

C<$signing_cert> is the X.509 certificate, in DER or PEM form, provided as a
string.  C<$signing_key> is the corresponding RSA private key, either in DER or
PEM form, also provided as a string.  C<$password> is the password used to
decrypt the private key.  If the private key is not encrypted, C<$password>
should be an empty string.

B<NOTE:> Storing the private key unencrypted is unsafe.
 
This method (or C<set_signer_path>) must be called before the C<sign>
method is called.  This method only needs to be called once, and then C<sign>
can be called multiple times.

Exceptions will be thrown if the certificate or key can not be read, or if the
password provided can not be used to decrypt the key.  If exceptions are caught,
but the program continues running, the instance which threw
the exception will be in an inconsistent state, and should not be used for
signing until C<set_signer> returns without errors.

=cut

sub set_signer {
    my ($self, $signing_cert, $signing_key, $password) = @_;
    
    ...
}


=head2 set_signer_path($cert_path, $key_path, $password)

This works the same as C<set_signer>, except the signing certificate and key
are stored in files.

The two files (C<$cert_path> and C<$key_path>) must both be readable.  They
will not be modified.

This method can die for the same reasons as C<set_signer>, and can also die if
the files can not be read.

=cut

sub set_signer_path {
    my ($self, $cert_path, $key_path, $password) = @_;
    
    ...
}


=head2 sign($profile)

Sign a configuration profile.

C<$profile> must be an instance of C<Config::Apple::Profile> which is ready for
exporting.  A serialized configuration profile is obtained from C<$profile>,
which is then signed.  The configuration profile, the signature, and a copy of
the signing certificate are kept together in a DER-encoded PKCS#7 structure,
which is returned to the client.

Either C<set_signer()> or C<set_signer_path()> must be called before C<sign()>.

The return value can be either an array or a scalar.  If a single scalar is
returned, that will be the path to the signed data.  If an array is returned,
the first entry in the array will be an open file handle, pointing to the start
of the signed data, and the second entry will be the path to the file.  The file
will be opened in C<binmode>.

The signed profile is binary data, and must be treated as such.  The file's
contents must not be modified in any way.  The client is responsible for
unlinking the file.

C<< $profile->export() >> will be called as part of the signing process, which
means C<$profile> may be modified by C<sign()>.

Exceptions will be thrown if signing credentials have not been provided, or if
signing fails.  The call to C<< $profile->export() >> may also cause exceptions
to be thrown.

=cut

sub sign {
    my ($self, $profile) = @_;
    
    ...
}


=head2 DESTROY()

Called automatically when an object is not being used anymore.  This closes
our OpenSSL password-communication pipe, and cleans up our temporary files.

=cut

sub DESTROY {
    my ($self) = @_;
    
    # Close our pipe
    close $self->{password_writer};
    close $self->{password_reader};
    
    # Let File::Temp clean itself up
    undef $self->{key_file};
    undef $self->{cert_file};
    
    # Good night!
    return 1;
}
