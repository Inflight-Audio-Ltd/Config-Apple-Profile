=head1 XML-AppleConfigProfile: Make Apple Configuration Profiles in Perl

Text goes here!

=head2 Installation

Installing the distribution is fairly straightforward.  This release uses
C<Module::Build>, so installation can be completed by running four commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

This release relies on a number of dependencies, but they should be easy to
install:

=over 4

=item *

Data::GUID

=item *

Exporter::Easy

=item *

Mac::PropertyList

=item *

Readonly

B<NOTE:> C<Readonly::XS> is not required, nor is it even necessary any more.

=item *

Regexp::Common

=head2 Documentation

All of the Perl modules have POD embedded throughout.  To get the documentation
on a particular module, you can use C<perldoc> after installation, for example:

    perldoc XML::AppleConfigProfile

The documentation in C<XML::AppleConfigProfile> is a good place for new clients
to start reading.

Documentation can also be found on CPAN at
L<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=XML&mode=module>.

Your code editor probably also has some way of easily accessing module docs.
